# Fix: Transform Toggle View Switching Issue

## Issue Details
**Date**: January 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Priority**: High

## Problem Description
When users clicked the "Transformed" toggle button, the current view was automatically switching to a different tab (e.g., from RAW view to DSSE view). This was unwanted behavior as users expected to stay on their current view when toggling transformations.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `PatternTabs.vue` component's `watch` function. When the transform toggle was clicked, it triggered a re-parse of the JSON data, which caused the `watch` function to detect a "new" JSON and automatically switch to the detected pattern tab (DSSE, SIGSTORE, etc.) instead of preserving the user's current view.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Modified Pattern Recognition Logic**: Changed the pattern detection to use `rawJson` instead of the transformed `parsedJson`. This ensures that pattern recognition is based on the original JSON structure.

2. **Added JSON Change Detection**: Implemented a tracking mechanism using `lastRawJsonString` to detect when the JSON is genuinely new vs. when it's just being re-parsed due to transform toggle.

3. **Conditional Tab Switching**: Modified the `watch` function to only auto-switch tabs when the JSON is actually new, not when it's the same JSON being re-processed.

4. **Updated Component Props**: Added `rawJson` prop to `PatternTabs.vue` component to receive the untransformed JSON data.

5. **Updated App.vue**: Modified the destructuring of `useJsonProcessor` to include `rawJson` and passed it to the `PatternTabs` component.

## Files Modified
- `src/components/PatternTabs/PatternTabs.vue`
  - Added `rawJson` prop
  - Changed `watch` function to use `props.rawJson` instead of `props.json`
  - Added `lastRawJsonString` tracking to detect genuine JSON changes
  - Modified tab switching logic to only auto-switch for new JSON
- `src/App.vue`
  - Added `rawJson` to destructuring from `useJsonProcessor`
  - Passed `rawJson` prop to `PatternTabs` component

## Testing Notes
- ✅ Transform toggle no longer switches views
- ✅ Pattern recognition still works correctly for new JSON
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No TypeScript errors introduced

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Bug fixed and tested

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now toggle transformations without losing their current view context
- **Functionality**: All existing features continue to work as expected
- **Performance**: No performance impact, minimal code changes
