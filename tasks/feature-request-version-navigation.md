# Feature Request: Version Navigation in About Popup

## Summary
Add version navigation functionality to the about popup to allow users to navigate between different versions of the application when deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Requirements
- Detect if user is viewing an older version
- Show "Go to Latest" link when on older version
- Show "Previous Version" link when on latest version
- Handle version detection from URL path
- Fetch latest version information
- Provide clear visual indicators for navigation

## Implementation Details

### Version Detection Logic
- Parse URL path to detect if on versioned path (`/v/{version}/`)
- Fetch latest version from `/latest/version.json`
- Compare current version with latest version
- Calculate previous version for navigation

### Navigation Features
- **Current Version Display**: Shows the version being viewed
- **Latest Version Link**: Appears when viewing older version, links to `/latest/`
- **Previous Version Link**: Appears when on latest version, links to previous version
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons and styling to distinguish between latest and previous links

### URL Structure Support
- `/latest/` - Latest version
- `/v/1.19/` - Specific version
- `/v/1.18/` - Previous version
- Root redirects to latest

## Files Modified

### `src/App.vue`
- Added version navigation computed properties
- Added latest version fetching logic
- Updated about popup template with navigation links
- Added CSS styles for version navigation components
- Added success color variables for theming

### Key Changes:
1. **Computed Properties**:
   - `currentVersion`: Detects version from URL path
   - `isOnLatestVersion`: Determines if viewing latest
   - `previousVersion`: Calculates previous version number
   - `getVersionUrl()`: Generates version-specific URLs
   - `getLatestUrl()`: Generates latest version URL

2. **Template Updates**:
   - Added version navigation section to about popup
   - Conditional display based on current version
   - Icons for visual clarity
   - Responsive link styling

3. **Styling**:
   - Version navigation container
   - Link styling with hover effects
   - Success color theming
   - Dark theme support

## Testing Scenarios

### When on Latest Version (`/latest/`)
- Shows current version
- Shows "Previous Version" link (if previous exists)
- No "Go to Latest" link

### When on Older Version (`/v/1.18/`)
- Shows current version
- Shows "Go to Latest" link
- No "Previous Version" link

### When on Root Path
- Redirects to latest automatically
- About popup shows latest version info
