# Feature Request: Transformation Toggle for JSON Viewer

## Request Details
**Date**: July 10, 2025  
**Requestor**: User  
**Type**: New Feature - UI/UX

## Description
Add a modern, icon-only toggle switch to the "Transformed Values" panel title that allows users to switch between viewing JSON with transformations (e.g., base64 decoding, epoch timestamp conversion) and viewing the raw JSON data. By default, transformations are enabled. The user's choice (on/off) is persisted in localStorage. The toggle is visually minimal, with no label or tooltip, and updates the view immediately.

## Requirements
- Add a modern, icon-only toggle switch to the "Transformed Values" panel title (not in the PatternTabs panel, and not next to the clipboard button).
- When enabled (default), the viewer applies all configured transformations to the JSON.
- When disabled, the viewer displays the raw JSON in a formatted view, with no transformations.
- The toggle state is saved in localStorage and restored on page load.
- The toggle updates the view immediately when changed.
- No label or tooltip is shown for the toggle; it is visually minimal and modern.

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Add a modern, icon-only toggle switch to the "Transformed Values" panel title.
- [x] Implement logic to switch between transformed and raw JSON views.
- [x] Store/retrieve the toggle state in localStorage.
- [x] Update the viewer in real time when toggled.
- [x] Remove toggle and all related UI from PatternTabs panel.
- [x] No label or tooltip is shown for the toggle; it is visually minimal and modern.

## Expected Behavior
- By default, users see transformed JSON.
- Toggling off shows the raw JSON (still pretty-printed, but without any value transformations).
- The toggle state is remembered across sessions.

## Status
ï¿½ **COMPLETE** - Feature implemented and merged

## Files to Modify
- `src/App.vue`
- `src/components/TransformedValuesPanel.vue`
- `src/components/PatternTabs/PatternTabs.vue` (toggle code removed)
- Any composables/utilities for transformation logic

## Testing Notes
- Verify toggle works and persists across reloads.
- Confirm both modes display as expected.
- Confirm toggle is only present in the "Transformed Values" panel, is icon-only, and has no label or tooltip.
- Confirm no toggle or related code appears in PatternTabs panel.
