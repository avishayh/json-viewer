  - Automatic loading of previous entries
  - Clear all history option
  - Persists across page reloads

## Use Cases

This viewer is particularly useful for:
- Viewing and validating DSSE envelopes
- Working with In-toto attestations and metadata
- Decoding base64-encoded payloads automatically
- Inspecting signed metadata and attestations
- Maintaining a history of recently viewed JSON documents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd json-viewer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Development

This project uses:
- Vite for fast development and building
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern web technologies for optimal performance
- Local Storage for persistent data
- Vue.js for reactive UI components

## Version Control

The project maintains version information in `version.json`, which tracks:
- Current version number
- Last update timestamp

## Live Demo

The latest version of JSON Viewer is always available at:

ï¿½ [https://avishayh.github.io/json-viewer](https://avishayh.github.io/json-viewer)

- This is the official GitHub Pages site for this repository.
- The app is always up-to-date with the latest release from the `master` branch.

## Versioned Releases

Every previous release is preserved and can be accessed at:

```
https://avishayh.github.io/json-viewer/v/{version}/
```

For example, to view version `1.9`:

```
https://avishayh.github.io/json-viewer/v/1.9/
```

The latest release is always available at:

```
https://avishayh.github.io/json-viewer/latest/
```

## Release Process

- On every push to `master`, a GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys the app to GitHub Pages.
- The workflow automatically increments the minor version (e.g., `1.9` â†’ `1.10`) in `version.json`.
- The `latest` folder always contains the most recent release.
- The previous `latest` is backed up to `/v/{version}/` before each new release.
- The `version.json` file is present in the root, `/latest/`, and each `/v/{version}/` folder, and contains the current version in `MAJOR.MINOR` format.

## How Versioning Works

- The version is managed automatically by the release workflow.
- Only the `version` field is present in `version.json`.
- The About popup in the app displays the current version.
